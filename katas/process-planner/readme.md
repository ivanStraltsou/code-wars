Process planner
================

In this task you have to code process planner.

You will be given initial thing, target thing and a set of processes to turn one thing into another (in the form of [process_name, start_thing, end_thing]). You must return names of shortest sequence of processes to turn initial thing into target thing, or empty sequence if it's impossible.

If start already equals end, return [], since no path is required.

```js
var test_processes = [
    ['gather', 'field', 'wheat'],
    ['bake', 'flour', 'bread'],
    ['mill', 'wheat', 'flour']
];

processes('field', 'bread', test_processes); // should return ['gather', 'mill', 'bake']
processes('field', 'ferrari', test_processes); // should return []
processes('field', 'field', test_processes); // should return [], since no processes are needed
```

Good luck!
